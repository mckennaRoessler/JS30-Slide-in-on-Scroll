# JS30-Slide-in-on-Scroll

This project helped me gain some more practice in offsetting HTML elements such that their position would be altered dependent on how far the viewer would be scrolled down within the window.

This project also introduced me to the debounce feature of JavaScript, which helps streamline the console's process of running a function by telling it to wait a certain amount of time before running the function again. This makes the process more efficient.
